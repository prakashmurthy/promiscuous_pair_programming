# Purpose of this site

PromiscuousPairProgramming.com (PPP.com for short) is a place where people can make "random" hookups
to practice pair programming.  We are still fleshing out the site and are looking for both
suggestions as well as development help to make the site the one stop shop for people
looking to practice pair programming, regardless of age, expertise level, gender, nationality, or programming language.

The name - and the concept - is inspired by [Chad Fowler](http://twitter.com/chadfowler)'s [interpretation of the message](http://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/26760442153) conveyed by [Aaron Patterson](http://twitter.com/tenderlove) during his keynote at [Mountain.rb conference](http://mountainrb.com/)

## Functionality suggestions/Bugs

All functionality suggestions are being kept in a public facing Pivotal Tracker project.  You
can find it here: [http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/132341](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/132341)

When entering stories, please use as much detail as you can to describe the new functionality or the bug.
Optimally you would use the [Given...When...Then](http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wiki/Given-When-Then)
 structure of Cucumber.  If that just doesn't work for you then please use as much detail as you can, as if you
 were giving driving instructions to you best friend who had never been to your new house.
